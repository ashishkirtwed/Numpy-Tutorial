    "#####         Numpy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in python.It is a python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects( e.g. masked array and matrices). It is best suitable for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete, basic linear algebra operations etc."

    "* NumPy arrays have a fixed size at creation, unlike Python lists (which can grow dynamically). Changing the size of an ndarray will create a new array and delete the original\n",
    "* The elements in a NumPy array are all required to be of the same data type, and thus will be the same size in memory. The exception: one can have arrays of (Python, including NumPy) objects, thereby allowing for arrays of different sized elements.\n",
    "* NumPy arrays facilitate advanced mathematical and other types of operations on large numbers of data. Typically,such operations are executed more efficiently and with less code than is possible using Pythonâ€™s built-in sequences"
